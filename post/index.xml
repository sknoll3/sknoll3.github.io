      <description>In NASCAR the line of weather or no you win a race is one that is very small. There have been multiple cases of when a drive could lead every stage of the race and still end up losing because of a flat tire or a caution that takes them out of the race. It might cause just the little bit of damage that ends their night.
So I was wondering does leading the most laps in a season really lead to the most wins?</description>
