      <description>In baseball times are changing.
If you looked at baseball just 10 years ago it would look drastically different than it is now. Pitch clocks have been implemented, robo umpires are being used, there is a limit on the number of mound visits you have, teams are shifting on every play. I could go on but that would be a blog with in itself. One of those things that is changing from year to year is the way steals are happenning.</description>

      <description>In NASCAR the line of weather or no you win a race is one that is very small. There have been multiple cases of when a drive could lead every stage of the race and still end up losing because of a flat tire or a caution that takes them out of the race. It might cause just the little bit of damage that ends their night.
So I was wondering does leading the most laps in a season really lead to the most wins?</description>
