      <description>Welcome to my blog! I am Sam Knoll and I am currently a Junior at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, studying Sports Media and Communication. These are all projects that I put together for my Sports Data and Visualization class at UNL in spring 2022. Personally I hope to someday be able to call all sports for a college in whatever division while also having my own sports show that talks with players and coaches of the college.</description>

      <description>In NASCAR the line of weather or no you win a race is one that is very small. There have been multiple cases of when a drive could lead every stage of the race and still end up losing because of a flat tire or a caution that takes them out of the race. It might cause just the little bit of damage that ends their night.
So I was wondering does leading the most laps in a season really lead to the most wins?</description>
